fish plugin that is compatible with fisher plugin manager, this plugin allows you easily recall specific arguments of recent history entries

examples:

!!
expands into: last command

!:2
expands into: second argument of last command

!2:-3
expands into: the third last argument of the second last command

!1:2..4
exapnds into: second to fourth argument of the last command

the indexing of arguments after : works like indexes of lists in fish, it accepts ranges, negative numbers and combinations of both, the first number indexes the history, !! is a short hand for !1, when this first number is specified it defaults to 1, it also accepts negavtive values but it does not accept ranges.
